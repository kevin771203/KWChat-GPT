# KWChat-GPT
A chatroom program that combines web-scraped articles with AI responses

1. Combining Web Scraping and Chat Functionality:
   This bot is not limited to generating chat responses but can dynamically scrape relevant content from PTT web pages using web scraping techniques (via requests and BeautifulSoup) to provide richer information in its responses.

2. Natural Language Processing and Keyword Extraction:
   The bot utilizes OpenAIâ€™s GPT model to generate conversations, and it enhances interactivity and intelligence by employing natural language processing techniques to extract keywords for external searches.

3. Real-time Search and Dynamic Content Generation:
   When specific topics arise, the bot performs real-time web searches (primarily using PTT) and dynamically generates response content, making its replies more relevant to current events or user needs.

4. Flask Web Application:
   This application is built using the Flask framework, providing a web interface that allows interaction with the bot via HTTP requests, making it easy to integrate into websites or applications.
